# Terminal TicTacToe

Text-based TicTacToe game that is playable in the terminal.

There is a local version, where 2 players can play within the same terminal windows, taking turns inputting their moves.

There are also Server-Client applications that can be run to play your opponent through the internet, via TCP sockets!

Currently, the local version is finished and the Server-Client applications are *functional.* I will be adding more to the latter shortly to make the connection between the Server and Client apps easier, and to make the matches more user friendly.

Let me know if and how you break my code!

**To Be Implemented:**
* Port & IP addresses as args when user launches client app
* Make server output pretty
* Play again option after game end
