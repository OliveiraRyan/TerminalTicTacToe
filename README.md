# Terminal TicTacToe

Text-based TicTacToe game that is playable in the terminal.

There are Server-Client applications that can be run to play your opponent through the internet, via TCP sockets!

There is also a local version, where 2 players can play within the same terminal windows, taking turns inputting their moves each turn.

Currently, the local version is finished and the Server-Client applications are *functional.* I will be adding more to the latter shortly to make the connection between the Server and Client apps easier, and to make the matches more user friendly.

Let me know if and how you break my code!

**To Be Implemented:**
* IP address & Port as args when user launches client app -- **DONE**
* Make server output pretty -- **DONE**
* Play again option after game end
